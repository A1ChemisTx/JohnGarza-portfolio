            Hi, I'm John Garza! <img src="html_finalprojimages/waving-hand.png" width="60px"/>
          </h1>
          <p>
            I've worked in the pharmaceutical industry for over 14 years as a quality control analyst, and supervisor. 
            Most recently I worked for a sunscreen company in their quality department as a quality manager.
            I'm currently working on my Full Stack Development certificate to purue a career change. Although this is challenging, 
            I find it incredibly interesting and fun working on projects that provide a sense of satisfaction upon completion.

          John is a diligent worker that embraces a challenge. He is not afraid to ask questions when he is unfamiliar with a task to ensure he has all the
          information to make the correct choice and complete the assignement.

            John is an incredible teammate that is willing to train his colleagues on tasks that are new to them. He is patient when training and provides guidance 
            as new employees embark on tacking projects on their own. He is always open to questions or providing a helping hand when needed.

        <div class="recommendation">
          <span>&#8220;</span>
            I worked with John for 3 years and during that time, I was able to rely on him to get the job done. He is quick to help others, but also seeks out help
            when he needs it. There was never a project to big for us when working as a team because we collaborated well. He will be a tremendous teammate for your
            team.
